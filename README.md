# ZaraDB 
###### Zara is a lightweight, simple but very fast document database.

#### Simple comparison with Mongodb:

###### select x12 faster
###### insert x6  faster
###### update x6  faster

###### RAM consumption is 18 times less
###### CPU consumption is 10 times less


##### Zara is currently under intensive development.
##### I will start documenting after the stabilization stage has arrived.

##### More description later.
